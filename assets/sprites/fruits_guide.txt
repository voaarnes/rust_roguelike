FRUITS SPRITE SHEET GUIDE (fruits.png)
=======================================
Create a 256x32 pixel sprite sheet (8 columns x 1 row of 32x32 sprites)

Fruit order (left to right):
0. Strawberry - Red with green top and seeds
1. Pear - Green/yellow gradient with characteristic shape
2. Mango - Orange/red gradient with oval shape
3. Apple - Red or green with shine highlight
4. Orange - Bright orange with textured surface
5. Grape - Purple cluster of small round grapes
6. Banana - Yellow curved fruit
7. Cherry - Red pair with green stems

Each fruit should be centered in its 32x32 cell with a slight glow or outline effect for visibility.
These correspond to the PowerUpType enum:
- 0,1 (Strawberry, Pear) = SpeedBoost
- 2,3 (Mango, Apple) = DamageBoost  
- 4,5 (Orange, Grape) = HealthBoost
- 6,7 (Banana, Cherry) = ShieldBoost
