FRUITS SPRITE SHEET GUIDE (fruits.png)
=======================================
Create a 224x32 pixel sprite sheet (7 columns x 1 row of 32x32 sprites)

Fruit order (left to right):
0. Strawberry - Red with green top and seeds
1. Pear - Green/yellow gradient with characteristic shape
2. Mango - Orange/red gradient with oval shape
3. Pineapple - Yellow with diamond pattern and leafy crown
4. Apple - Red or green with shine highlight
5. Carrot - Orange with green leafy top
6. Coconut - Brown with fibrous texture

Each fruit should be centered in its 32x32 cell with a slight glow or outline effect for visibility.
These correspond to the PowerUpType enum:
- 0,1 (Strawberry, Pear) = SpeedBoost
- 2,3 (Mango, Pineapple) = DamageBoost  
- 4,5 (Apple, Carrot) = HealthBoost
- 6 (Coconut) = ShieldBoost
