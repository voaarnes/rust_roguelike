PLAYER PARTS SPRITE SHEET GUIDE (player_parts.png)
====================================================
Create a 256x192 pixel sprite sheet (8 columns x 6 rows of 32x32 sprites)

- 4: Apple head (shiny red/green)

- 6: Grape head (purple cluster pattern) - DEFAULT
- 7: Banana head (yellow with slight curve)

Row 1 (indices 8-15): More head variations
- 8: Cherry head (dark red with stem detail)
- 9-15: Future expansions or animation frames

Row 2 (indices 16-23): Chest/torso variations
- 16: Default chest
- 17: Strawberry chest (red with seeds pattern)
- 18: Pear chest (green/yellow gradient)
- 19: Mango chest (orange/red gradient)
- 20: Apple chest (shiny red/green)
- 21: Orange chest (bright orange with texture)
- 22: Grape chest (purple cluster pattern) - DEFAULT
- 23: Banana chest (yellow with slight curve)

Row 3 (indices 24-31): More chest variations
- 24: Cherry chest (dark red with stem detail)
- 25-31: Future expansions or animation frames

Row 4 (indices 32-39): Legs variations
- 32: Default legs
- 33: Strawberry legs (red with seeds pattern)
- 34: Pear legs (green/yellow gradient)
- 35: Mango legs (orange/red gradient)
- 36: Apple legs (shiny red/green)
- 37: Orange legs (bright orange with texture)
- 38: Grape legs (purple cluster pattern) - DEFAULT
- 39: Banana legs (yellow with slight curve)

Row 5 (indices 40-47): More legs variations
- 40: Cherry legs (dark red with stem detail)
- 41-47: Future expansions or animation frames

Each fruit should have a distinct visual theme that carries through head, chest, and legs.
The grape design (indices 6, 22, 38) should be used as the default when no fruits are equipped.
