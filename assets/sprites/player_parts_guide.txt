====================================================
Create a 256x192 pixel sprite sheet (8 columns x 6 rows of 32x32 sprites)

Layout (48 total sprites):
Row 0 (indices 0-7): Head variations for fruits
- 0: Default head

- 4: Pineapple head (yellow with diamond pattern)
- 5: Apple head (shiny red/green)
- 6: Carrot head (orange with leafy top)
- 7: Coconut head (brown with fibrous texture)

Row 1 (indices 8-15): More head variations
- 8-15: Future expansions or animation frames

Row 2 (indices 16-23): Chest/torso variations
- 16: Default chest
- 17: Strawberry chest (red with seeds pattern)
- 18: Pear chest (green/yellow gradient)
- 19: Mango chest (orange/red gradient)
- 20: Pineapple chest (yellow with diamond pattern)
- 21: Apple chest (shiny red/green)
- 22: Carrot chest (orange with leafy top)
- 23: Coconut chest (brown with fibrous texture)

Row 3 (indices 24-31): More chest variations
- 24-31: Future expansions or animation frames

Row 4 (indices 32-39): Legs variations
- 32: Default legs
- 33: Strawberry legs (red with seeds pattern)
- 34: Pear legs (green/yellow gradient)
- 35: Mango legs (orange/red gradient)
- 36: Pineapple legs (yellow with diamond pattern)
- 37: Apple legs (shiny red/green)
- 38: Carrot legs (orange with leafy top)
- 39: Coconut legs (brown with fibrous texture)

Row 5 (indices 40-47): More legs variations
- 40-47: Future expansions or animation frames

Each fruit should have a distinct visual theme that carries through head, chest, and legs.
The default design (indices 0, 16, 32) should be used when no fruits are equipped.
